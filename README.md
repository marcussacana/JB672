# PS4 6.7.2 Exploit Host for Personal Use
I don't take credit for any of the software, including webkit and HEN and there is no advantage using this host like stability or any other thing, I also disclaim responsibility in case of instability or errors. 
This host is made for personal use and nothing more and is only public to take advantage of the github pages feature.  
The Webkit is just a copy of the sleirsgoevy implementation.  
The payloads contained therein are also the property of their respective creators and not mine. 

The point of this host is just be in my native language, Portuguese Brazilian, and accept bin files to make my life easy.
